\begin{slide}{Conclusions}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Re-designed and Implemented \SWEEP
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Demonstrated the capabilities of \SWEEP
    \item Better suited for larger/more complex problems
    \item Successfully used in applications outside this work
    \end{itemize}
    
  \item Designed and implemented \ECS
  \item Established the feasibility of evolving state machines for swarm algorithms
  \item Successfully generated swarm algorithms for a number of different scenarios
  \item Demonstrated the use of composite metrics and radix-based ranking to address multi-objective problems
  \end{itemize}
