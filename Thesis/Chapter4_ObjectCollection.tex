Object manipulation is a standard problem in both artificial intelligence  and multi-agent systems .  The basic premise of the scenario is that a number of objects are randomly scattered over a region and those object need to be operated on in some manner, such as being destroyed or returned to some goal area.  The object manipulation problem is the selected due to its widely applicable nature to real-world multi-agent scenarios.  For example, a swarm of minesweeping robots need to first find a hidden landmine before it can be collected and returned for proper disposal .  From a theoretical standpoint, object collection also is interesting in the fact that this problem that does not have a trivial solution.  Agents must first coordinate to find all the objects, and then they must act upon those objects.  Therefore, the object collection problem is a multi-stage problem that requires agent interactions to be completed successfully.
