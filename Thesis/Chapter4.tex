\chapter{SWEEP Applications}
\label{ch:SweepApplications}

This chapter presents three progressively more complex swarm demonstrations using the \SWEEP{} platform.  The \textbf{agent dispersion} demonstration implements a simple algorithm that physically disperses a swarm to a predefined density.  The \textbf{task assignment} demonstration implements a decentralized task assignment algorithm which is able to find \qw{good solutions quickly}.  Finally, \textbf{chemical cloud tracking} is presented as a more comprehensive demonstration.  In the scenario, a swarm of UAVs (unmanned air vehicles) is tasked to search for and map a chemical cloud in a bounded region.  This demonstration includes UAV agents that respect the flight dynamics of a simple UAV, an environment with simple wind conditions and a chemical cloud, and the use of \SWEEP{} within a Monte Carlo analysis framework.
