  This work implements and demonstrates a set of tools to automatically
  generate swarm algorithms.  \SWEEP{}, \SWEEPexp{}, a swarm algorithm
  development and simulation platform is implemented.  To demonstrate
  the utility of \SWEEP{}, several swarm-based algorithms are
  constructed for free-moving and dynamics-constrained agents, 
  culminating in the development of basic searching and mapping
  algorithms for unmanned air vehicles tracking chemical clouds.  
  \ECS{}, \ECSexp{}, is implemented to evolve swarm algorithms that 
  exhibit emergent behavior.  \ECS{} represents solutions as finite
  state machines, utilizes \SWEEP{} to simulate a swarm executing each 
  state machine solution, and employs radix-based ranking to address 
  the multi-objective nature of the problem.  As a demonstration of the 
  ability of \ECS{}, swarm algorithms for agent dispersion, object
  collection, and object destruction are evolved and discussed.
