\chapter{Results of Evolving Swarm Behaviors}
\label{ch:Results}

The goal of this chapter is to develop several proof-of-concept scenarios showing how evolutionary computing can be leveraged to design swarm algorithms.  This chapter presents the results of using the evolutionary computing system outlined in \refChapter{EvolutionaryGeneration} to breed swarm algorithms for two basic swarm functionalities, swarm dispersion and object manipulation.  The goal of swarm dispersion is for every agent in the swarm to satisfy some conditions of their positions resulting in a swarm of a certain density.  The swarm dispersion problem is relatively simple, but serves as a proof-of-concept of the functionality of \ECS.  The second problem examined is object manipulation where agent attempt to collect one type of object and destroy a different type of object.  As there are many different approaches that may be taken to address the object manipulation problem, thus providing an adequate final scenario to test the abilities of the \ECS.

Each section in this chapter is broken down into three subsections: description, implementation, and results.  The first section gives a detailed overview of the problem and the scenario.  The second section outlines the agent configuration and parameters used for the evolving the target behavior.  The third section presents the results of evolving the target swarm behavior.
