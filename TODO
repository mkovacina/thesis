* Setup 'include ../Makefile' to automatically do backup- and sync-
* Put in hooks for custom actions with backup- and sync-
* Same for clean-
* Get propser to work from relative paths
* Maybe come up with an outline mode in latex
* Pull stuff out of preamble into miko.tex or something
* Make my own common or contrib directory

* The following example defines an environment, called |fmpage|, that is
a framed version of |minipage|.
\begin{verbatim}
   \newsavebox{\fmbox}
   \newenvironment{fmpage}[1]
     {\begin{lrbox}{\fmbox}\begin{minipage}{#1}}
     {\end{minipage}\end{lrbox}\fbox{\usebox{\fmbox}}}
\end{verbatim}

* bug in propser, slide title with \texttt{}, the exttt shows up in the slide title in the slide browser, at least in xpdf

* make so that the bolding of figure/table refs is selectable and defaultable
